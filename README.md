# Developing logistics services by using the Internet of Things - IoT
This Project was made to improve the monitoring for shipment packages end to end, to make sure the package is safe from increasing temperature and if the package dropped heavily to the ground, In cooperation with my team, we implemented an IoT system with MQTT protocol.

## __System Features:__
1. ensure the safety of the packages
2. ensure the packages are not been tampered with by the shipping company
3. ensure the surrounding environment for the contents of the packages
4. monitor the temperature and humidity of the packages
5. monitor the packages from point A to B

## __Tools and Programs:__
* IoT System:
    - NodeMCU ESP8266
    - IDE Version: 1.8.16
    - Framework Board Version: 2.5.0

* Mqtt Brocker:
    - Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+
    - Mosquitto V2.0.11
  
* Monitoring System:
    - Mqtt Explorer
    - Mqtt.fx V1.7.1

## __Future Plans:__
  * Blockchain implementation to ensure the system integrity 
  * Make the system track GPS
  * Make an interface 
  * Make Permissions authority for the users
  * Minimize the power consumption
  * Minimize the price tag for the unit
