# Developing logistics services by using the Internet of Things - IoT

This Project was made to improve the monitoring for shipment packages end to end, to make sure the package is safe from increasing temperature and if the package dropped heavily to the ground, In cooperation with my team, we implemented an IoT system with MQTT protocol, ESP8266 as a Client monitoring and Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ as a Broker.
